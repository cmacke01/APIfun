    <ul>
      <li>
        I selected this API because I love cats and I miss my cat very much <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        I found the API through https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/,
         and the API data can be found here https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        I used new XMLHttpRequest() to access this data, which allowed me to use open()
        to request the data from the server (it returns a JSON string).
        I used the onreadystatechange event handler to display the data when the data was ready.
        I parsed the JSON string back into an object and accessed the "text"
        field of two of the facts, which were in an array.
      </li>
      <li>
        This API updates daily, so it could be used on a veterenarian's website to generate the
        "cat fact of the day."  It could also be used on a pet adoption agency's elist, and it
        could email a cat fact of the day to their clients.
      </li>
    </ul>
